There's this weird virus thing on Tumblr going on called a \"Security Warning\"where it says you're suspected of bad behavior.
//t.co/CLe85a50 they say it's some kind of virus
the security warning thing is a virus
k just staying off tumblr for the next couple of days because this 'security warning apparently a virus cookie nabbing oh no' thing is weird
Was that - IMPOANT: \"Security Warning\"- shit on @Tumblr a virus?
There's a virus going around on tumblr\nIf you get a security warning DO NOT CLICK IT
That's pretty messed up that someone would start a rumor that that Tumblr security notice was a virus. I didn't get it, but a guy I know did
Anti-virus isn't dead. But when it comes to targeted attacks, it has been outgunned, //t.co/o6ZJG2d5
@tumblr Hey, I'm wondering if it's true that the security page problem is a virus.
apparently that tumblr security thing was a virus??? idk????
@chloe_bieber idek but everyone's getting some 'security warning' thing, some thinks its a virus but I went through with it and nothing
so who else is waiting for every other social networking site to go OMG CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD SECURITY BREACH followed by it's a virus guys!
So I did all of that stuff to get rid of the supposed tumblr virus and now my email is locked bc I couldn't remember the security question.
If you have a Tumblr there's a virus running rampant on there right now. Here's info and how to deal with it: http://t.co/fUK1u6T6

@tonymazur The cleveland CBS local website article about superglued woman is infected with Security Shield virus. Please let your ppl know.
Anyone know a foolproof way of removing the Security Shield virus? I'm a bit concerned that some of the ways are really more viruses.
Still battling to remove this fake Security Shield virus. Computer only runs in safe mode. Any tips gratefully received.
Guys, its not a virus. I scanned it with McAfee &amp; Windows Security essentials. (//t.co/ReQpfk96)
Took over an hour, but I got my computer sorted. FYI all, if you get the Security Shield virus, Malwarebytes in safe mode will remove it.
