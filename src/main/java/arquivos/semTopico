@ericbolling He beefed up security the DAY OF the attack....Great CIC!!!
Why doesn't the administration have a straight answer on what happened in Libya attack and security beforehand, even now?
@nbc6 Pres. avoided Mr. Kerry's question about enhanced security BEFORE the embassy attack. He danced around it!
To be fair, the president failed to answer 1 question: “Why weren’t pre-attack requests for extra security in Libya granted?”
First question about foreign policy- Libya and Benghazi attack: Why was extra security denied for dips in Libya?
Beef up security during the attack? It's a little late ain't it.
@ames_not_james admitting he was wrong puts an \"ATTACK HERE\"sticker on gitmo. Some secrets are for national security.

@linne I hereby recommend you for next moderator. \"what would you do during zombie invasion?\"\"Can we get Ironman for national security?\"
Obama pivoted the question (on security requests) to the attack aftermath, leading Romney to \"act of terror\"comment
In addition Obama did say act of terror but looked @ the attack as a response to a youtube video, plus gave no security to the US Ambassador
Mr.Pres (4now)u were asked \"prior to the attack in Libya..why did the request for added security go unanswered\". .answer honestly for once..
@cough_mann23 to the fact that Obama said he called national security. He never said it was a terrorist attack.
Obama's answer to Benghazi attack is to blame Romney for press release! What about security? What about coverup? What about leading????
@crowthercrow How would acknowledging that it was a terrorist attack change the outcome?? More importantly is why was security lacking.
@LoganStowell how is that silly at all? Logan do you honestly not care about national security. You may say they wouldn't attack us.
Romney destroyed his ethos when falsely accusing Obama during National Security, more specifically the attack in Libya was being addressed

@KetlerTori He did raise security in Libya. It was a terrorist attack, and he said it was a terrorist attack day 1 in the Rose Garden.
Who cut security. Who told Rice to lie. Why wasn't compound secured post-attack. Why did Obama still lie 2 wks later. @htmcg @kesgardner

Hey O'Reilly, Obama planned the Embassy attack to give him a Hostage negotiation, that backfired. That's was security was drawn down.
The ambassador requesteded more security before the attack. Patton would slap you for supporting communist.@GeneralClark @TheOReilyFactor
Obama approved Embassy attack plans. looking to have a Hostage negotiation when MB visited WH in July. That's why security was reduced.
If the Benghazi security was considered adequate, why were there no dead terrorists after the attack?
@BretBaier @twitter Bottom line is security was denied and taken away before the attack. Why?
PLEASE, Obama, explain why you CUT security after the June 6, 2012 terrorist attack on the Benghazi consulate.
Requests from diplomats for more security in Benghazi months \nbefore the terrorist attack were not approved. #debates WHY not?
Dude, Obama slashed embassy security after the June 6, 2012 terrorist attack on the Benghazi consulate. Leading to four deaths. HIT HARD.
So Security had drone over Benghazi throughout attack.  When will Obama come clean. Either lying or incompetent or too busy campaigning.

Romney &amp; Obama disagree on how best to attack \"our enemies\"in \"the Muslim world\"&amp; \"defend Israel's security\"Seriously this is f-ing gross
Cyber security. Brought to you by the party that leaked the cyber attack on Iran. I'm convinced.
Obama can't really talk about what people are asking for - Stevens asked for increased security at least 2 months prior to Benghazi attack.
The US embassador in Libya was asking for more security and protection up to 44 days before the attack, and Obama didn't do a thing about it

@KickRocksFool no. He knew beforehand of the planned attack and informed security to stand down. That was the cover up.
@DazzlingWriter He refused to call it a terror attack and the consulate was DENIED their requests for extra security.
@lo_valente @Edward_Dumas To clarify, the requests were for security at the EMBASSY, the attack was at the CONSULATE. different places.
